        <em>Ingredients</em>
    </h2>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shiro powder</li>
            <li>1 onion, large, diced</li>
            <li>⅓ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium sized pot or Dutch oven, heat ½ cup of olive oil on low to medium heat. Add 1 diced onion over
                low to medium heat for a few minutes. This is just to get the aromatics fragrant so 1-2 minutes is sufficient,
                don't let it brown!</li>
            <li>Next, add a teaspoon of minced garlic along with the tomato paste and sauté for 30 seconds until the garlic is
                fragrant.</li> 
            <li>Now, add the shiro powder, along with salt and 3 cups of water, and bring to a boil on medium heat. Then, turn
                down the heat to a low to medium, and let it simmer for about 20 to 30 minutes to allow the mixture to thicken
                to your desired consistency. Stir at 5 minute increments to ensure it doesn't stick. The oil will float to the
                top when the shiro is done cooking! Taste and adjust salt and serve hot with rice or injera!</li>
        </ol>

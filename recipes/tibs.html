        <em>How to Make Tibs</em>
    </h2>

    <p>This dish is super easy to make, but you do need a few unusual ingredients and spices, and you need to have everything set to go before you start cooking because it comes together very fast. First, you must get yourself some Ethiopian berbere. It comes as either a spice mixture or a paste. You can buy it online or in places like Whole Foods or Cost Plus Market, or you can make it yourself. You'll also need clarified butter, although this tastes more authentic if you make your own Ethiopian spiced butter. Of the many spices listed in the ingredients, the most important is the fenugreek. It is this spice that makes the version of tibs we served at Horn of Africa different from most others. </p>

        <em>Ingredients</em>
    </h2>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large red onion, about 2 cups, sliced thin</li>
            <li>▢1/4 cup niter kebbeh or ghee spiced butter</li>
            <li>▢2 pounds venison, lamb or beef, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>▢2 tablespoons berbere</li>
            <li>▢1 teaspoon ground fenugreek</li>
            <li>▢1/2 teaspoon cardamom (optional)</li>
            <li>▢1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>▢1/4 teaspoon cumin</li>
            <li>▢1/4 teaspoon ground clove</li>
            <li>▢1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>▢3 to 4 garlic cloves, sliced thinly</li>
            <li>▢2 cups whole peeled tomatoes, broken into bits</li>
            <li>▢1 to 5 green chiles, such as jalapenos or serranos</li>
            <li>▢1/2 cup red wine</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Get the saute pan or wok very hot. Stir-fry the onions without the butter for a few minutes, until they char just a little on the outside. Add the spiced butter and the venison. Stir-fry hot and fast until the outside of the meat is brown but the inside of the meat is still very rare. You need to do this on as hot a burner as you have. Do it in two batches unless you have a very large wok or pan<li>
                In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and water (and yeast if you're using it). Loosely place some plastic wrap on the bowl (it needs some air circulation, you just want to keep any critters out) and let the mixture sit undisturbed at room temperature for 4-5 days (the longer it ferments, the deeper the flavor). (Depending on what kind of flour you're using, you may need to add a little more water if the mixture is becoming dry.)  The mixture will be fizzy, the color will be very dark and, depending on the humidity, a layer of aerobic yeast will have formed on the top. (Aerobic yeast is a normal result of fermentation.  If however your batter forms mold on it, it will need to be discarded.) Pour off the aerobic yeast and as much of the liquid as possible. A clay-like batter will remain. Give it a good stir.</li> 
            
            <li>The moment the meat has browned, add it all back into the pan along with the spices, garlic and chiles. Stir-fry another 30 seconds or so, then add the tomatoes and the wine. Toss to combine and let this cook for a minute or two. Serve at once with bread or injera.</li>
        </ol>
